      <h1>🌹    My Love 🌹

   

From the moment we met, my heart knew you were someone special. Every smile, every conversation, and every little moment we've shared has only made me fall for you more.

You are my happiness, my safe place, and the reason behind my brightest days. I cherish the way you understand me without words, how you support me without question, and how you make my world feel complete.

Today, I want to take a step forward and ask you—will you be mine forever? Will you let me walk beside you, holding your hand through every joy and challenge?

I promise to stand by your side, to love you with all my heart, and to make every day as special as you are to me.

Will you be my forever? 💖 💍❤️</h1>
